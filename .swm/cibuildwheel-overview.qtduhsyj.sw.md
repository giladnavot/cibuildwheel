title: cibuildwheel overview
---
The cibuildwheel repo is a tool designed to help build Python wheels. Python wheels are a standard format for distributing Python libraries and applications. This tool supports building these wheels across multiple platforms including Mac, Linux, and Windows, on multiple versions of Python. It's designed to work with various Continuous Integration (CI) servers, making it easier to automate the process of building, testing, and distributing Python packages.
