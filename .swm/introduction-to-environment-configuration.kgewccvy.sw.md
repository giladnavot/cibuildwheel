title: Introduction to Environment Configuration
---
Environment Configuration in cibuildwheel refers to the setup and management of environment variables that influence the behavior of the build process. This is achieved through classes and functions that parse, evaluate, and manage environment variables. The `EnvironmentAssignment` protocol defines the structure for environment variable assignments, while the `EnvironmentAssignmentBash` and `EnvironmentAssignmentRaw` classes handle bash-syntax and simple name/value pair environment variables respectively. The `ParsedEnvironment` class is used to manage a list of environment assignments, providing functionality to convert these assignments into a dictionary, add new assignments, and get a summary of the options. The `as_dictionary` method is particularly important as it is used across different modules to apply the environment configuration.

## Environment Variables

The `EnvironmentAssignment` class represents an environment variable. It has a `name` and a method `evaluated_value` that returns the value of the variable as evaluated in the environment.

```python
class EnvironmentAssignment(Protocol):
    name: str

    def evaluated_value(
        self,
        *,
        environment: Mapping[str, str],
        executor: bashlex_eval.EnvironmentExecutor | None = None,
    ) -> str:
        """Returns the value of this assignment, as evaluated in the environment"""
```

## Parsing Environment Variables

The `parse_environment` function is used to parse environment variables from a string. It uses the `EnvironmentAssignmentBash` class to create an assignment for each item in the environment string.

```python
def parse_environment(env_string: str) -> ParsedEnvironment:
    env_items = split_env_items(env_string)
    assignments = [EnvironmentAssignmentBash(item) for item in env_items]
    return ParsedEnvironment(assignments=assignments)
```

## Environment Configuration in Action

The `as_dictionary` method of the `ParsedEnvironment` class is used to convert the environment configuration into a dictionary that can be used in the build process. This is an example of how it's used in the macOS build process.

```python
    # Apply our environment after pip is ready
    env = environment.as_dictionary(prev_environment=env)
```
