title: 'Avoiding Redundant Builds: Validating Pre-existing Python Wheels '
---
This document will cover the process of how cibuildwheel validates if a wheel has already been built for a specific Python configuration. The topics covered include:

1. The role of the <SwmToken path="/cibuildwheel/util.py" pos="483:2:2" line-data="class AlreadyBuiltWheelError(Exception):">`AlreadyBuiltWheelError`</SwmToken> class
2. The use of the <SwmToken path="/cibuildwheel/util.py" pos="760:2:2" line-data="def find_compatible_wheel(wheels: Sequence[T], identifier: str) -&gt; T | None:">`find_compatible_wheel`</SwmToken> function
3. The build process across different platforms.

# The role of the <SwmToken path="/cibuildwheel/util.py" pos="483:2:2" line-data="class AlreadyBuiltWheelError(Exception):">`AlreadyBuiltWheelError`</SwmToken> class

The <SwmToken path="/cibuildwheel/util.py" pos="483:2:2" line-data="class AlreadyBuiltWheelError(Exception):">`AlreadyBuiltWheelError`</SwmToken> class is used to raise an exception when a wheel with the same name has already been generated in the current run. The error message suggests checking the project configuration or running cibuildwheel with <SwmToken path="/cibuildwheel/util.py" pos="490:5:7" line-data="            cibuildwheel with CIBW_BUILD_VERBOSITY=1 to view build logs.">`CIBW_BUILD_VERBOSITY=1`</SwmToken> to view build logs.

```python
class AlreadyBuiltWheelError(Exception):
    def __init__(self, wheel_name: str) -> None:
        message = textwrap.dedent(
            f"""
            cibuildwheel: Build failed because a wheel named {wheel_name} was already generated in the current run.

            If you expected another wheel to be generated, check your project configuration, or run
            cibuildwheel with CIBW_BUILD_VERBOSITY=1 to view build logs.
            """
        )

        super().__init__(message)

It checks various conditions to determine if a wheel is compatible.

    specified by `identifier` that is previously built.

    if free_threaded:
        interpreter = interpreter[:-1]
    for wheel in wheels:
        _, _, _, tags = parse_wheel_filename(wheel.name)
        for tag in tags:
            if tag.abi == "abi3" and not free_threaded:
                # ABI3 wheels must start with cp3 for impl and tag
                if not (interpreter.startswith("cp3") and tag.interpreter.startswith("cp3")):
                    continue
