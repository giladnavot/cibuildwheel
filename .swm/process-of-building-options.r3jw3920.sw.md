title: Process of Building Options
---
This document will cover the process of building options in the cibuildwheel project, which includes:

1. Getting the named option from environment, configuration file, or the default.
2. Resolving a cascade of values with inherit rules into a single value.
3. Converting the setting to a string.
4. Formatting the key-value pairs.

## Where is this flow used?

The flow starts with the function `build_options`. It is called from multiple entry points as represented in the following diagram:

```mermaid
graph TD;
  build:::rootsStyle --> build_in_container
  build_in_container --> build_options:::mainFlowStyle
  main:::rootsStyle --> main_inner
  main_inner --> build_in_directory
  build_in_directory --> print_preamble
  print_preamble --> summary
  summary --> build_options:::mainFlowStyle
  build:::rootsStyle --> build_options:::mainFlowStyle

 classDef mainFlowStyle color:#000000,fill:#7CB9F4
  classDef rootsStyle color:#000000,fill:#00FFF4
```

## The flow itself

```mermaid
graph TD;
subgraph cibuildwheel/options.py
  build_options:::mainFlowStyle --> get
end
subgraph cibuildwheel/options.py
  get:::mainFlowStyle --> _resolve_cascade
end
subgraph cibuildwheel/options.py
  _resolve_cascade:::mainFlowStyle --> _stringify_setting
end
subgraph cibuildwheel/options.py
  _stringify_setting:::mainFlowStyle --> _inner_fmt
end
  _inner_fmt:::mainFlowStyle --> ...

 classDef mainFlowStyle color:#000000,fill:#7CB9F4
  classDef rootsStyle color:#000000,fill:#00FFF4
```

# Getting the named option

The function `get` is used to retrieve the value for the named option from the environment, configuration file, or the default. It also handles platform-specific options and config overrides.

```python
    def get(
        self,
        name: str,
        *,
        env_plat: bool = True,
        list_sep: str | None = None,
        table_format: TableFmt | None = None,
        ignore_empty: bool = False,
    ) -> str:
        """
        Get and return the value for the named option from environment,
        configuration file, or the default. If env_plat is False, then don't
        accept platform versions of the environment variable. If this is an
        array it will be merged with "sep" before returning. If it is a table,
        it will be formatted with "table['item']" using {k} and {v} and merged
        with "table['sep']". If sep is also given, it will be used for arrays
        inside the table (must match table['sep']). Empty variables will not
        override if ignore_empty is True.
        """

        if name not in self.default_options and name not in self.default_platform_options:

# Resolving a cascade of values

The function `_resolve_cascade` is used to resolve a cascade of values with inherit rules into a single value. It handles different types of values and their merging rules.

```python
def _resolve_cascade(
    *pairs: tuple[Setting | None, InheritRule],
    ignore_empty: bool = False,
    list_sep: str | None = None,
    table_format: TableFmt | None = None,
) -> str:
    """
    Given a cascade of values with inherit rules, resolve them into a single
    value.

    'None' values mean that the option was not set at that level, and are
    ignored. If `ignore_empty` is True, empty values are ignored too.

    Values start with defaults, followed by more specific rules. If rules are
    NONE, the last non-null value is returned. If a rule is APPEND or PREPEND,
    the value is concatenated with the previous value.

    The following idiom can be used to get the first matching value:

        _resolve_cascade(("value1", Inherit.NONE), ("value2", Inherit.NONE), ...)))
    """
```

# Converting the setting to a string

The function `_stringify_setting` is used to convert the setting to a string. It handles different types of settings including mappings, sequences, booleans, and integers.

```python
def _stringify_setting(
    setting: Setting, list_sep: str | None, table_format: TableFmt | None
) -> str:
    if isinstance(setting, Mapping):
        if table_format is None:
            msg = f"Error converting {setting!r} to a string: this setting doesn't accept a table"
            raise ConfigOptionError(msg)
        return table_format["sep"].join(
            item for k, v in setting.items() for item in _inner_fmt(k, v, table_format)
        )

    if not isinstance(setting, str) and isinstance(setting, Sequence):
        if list_sep is None:
            msg = f"Error converting {setting!r} to a string: this setting doesn't accept a list"
            raise ConfigOptionError(msg)
        return list_sep.join(setting)

    if isinstance(setting, (bool, int)):
        return str(setting)

    return setting
```

# Formatting the key-value pairs

The function `_inner_fmt` is used to format the key-value pairs. It handles different types of values and applies the appropriate formatting.

```python
def _inner_fmt(k: str, v: Any, table: TableFmt) -> Iterator[str]:
    quote_function = table.get("quote", lambda a: a)

    if isinstance(v, list):
        for inner_v in v:
            qv = quote_function(inner_v)
            yield table["item"].format(k=k, v=qv)
    elif isinstance(v, bool):
        qv = quote_function(str(v))
        yield table["item"].format(k=k, v=qv)
    else:
        qv = quote_function(v)
        yield table["item"].format(k=k, v=qv)
```
