title: 'Implementing Platform-Specific Configurations '
---
This document will cover the implementation of platform-specific configurations in cibuildwheel, which includes:

1. How platform-specific configurations are defined
2. How these configurations are used in the codebase
3. The role of the `tool` constant in platform-specific configurations.

# Defining Platform-Specific Configurations

Platform-specific configurations are defined in the `defaults.toml` file. This file contains global constants that define the default settings for the cibuildwheel tool. Each platform (Linux, macOS, Windows, Pyodide) has its own section with specific settings.

```toml
[tool.cibuildwheel]
build = "*"
skip = ""
test-skip = ""
free-threaded-support = false

archs = ["auto"]
build-frontend = "default"
config-settings = {}
dependency-versions = "pinned"
environment = {}
environment-pass = []
build-verbosity = 0

before-all = ""
before-build = ""
repair-wheel-command = ""

test-command = ""
before-test = ""
test-requires = []
```

# Using Platform-Specific Configurations in the Codebase

The platform-specific configurations are imported and used in the `__main__.py` file. The `Architecture` and `PLATFORMS` constants from the `cibuildwheel.architecture` and `cibuildwheel.typing` modules respectively, are used to determine the platform and architecture for the build process.

```python
import cibuildwheel.util
import cibuildwheel.windows
from cibuildwheel import errors
from cibuildwheel._compat.typing import assert_never
from cibuildwheel.architecture import Architecture, allowed_architectures_check
from cibuildwheel.logger import log
from cibuildwheel.options import CommandLineArguments, Options, compute_options
from cibuildwheel.typing import PLATFORMS, GenericPythonConfiguration, PlatformName
from cibuildwheel.util import (
    CIBW_CACHE_PATH,
    BuildSelector,
    CIProvider,
    Unbuffered,
    chdir,
    detect_ci_provider,
    fix_ansi_codes_for_github_actions,
    strtobool,
)
```

# The Role of the `tool` Constant

The `tool` constant is used to specify the settings for each platform. It is used in the `defaults.toml` file to define the default settings for each platform. It is also used in the `options.py` file to handle any overrides specified by the user.

```toml
[tool.cibuildwheel]
build = "*"
skip = ""
test-skip = ""
free-threaded-support = false

archs = ["auto"]
build-frontend = "default"
config-settings = {}
dependency-versions = "pinned"
environment = {}
environment-pass = []
build-verbosity = 0

before-all = ""
before-build = ""
repair-wheel-command = ""

test-command = ""
before-test = ""
test-requires = []
```
