title: Overview of Dependency Management
---
Dependency Management in cibuildwheel is handled through the use of constraint files. These files, like `constraints.txt`, specify the exact versions of the packages that the project depends on. This ensures that the build process is repeatable and consistent across different environments. The constraint files are automatically generated and updated using a tool called `nox`.

# Constraints File

This is the constraints file used for dependency management in cibuildwheel. Each line specifies a dependency and its version. The `# via` comments indicate the package that requires the dependency.
